            <h2>The Food Waste Crisis</h2>
            <div class="area">
                <h3>Magnitude of the Problem</h3>
                <p>Food waste in Sub-Saharan Africa is a pressing issue, exacerbated by rapid population growth. Households contribute significantly to this problem, with 96% reporting weekly food waste. Institutions and produce markets also contribute, generating substantial amounts of waste daily.</p>
                <p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Household waste:</strong> Ugandan households generate an average of 680 tons of food waste daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional waste:</strong> Institutions such as schools and restaurants contribute 80 tons daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Produce market waste:</strong> Produce markets generate 8 tons of food waste daily.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="area">
                <h3>Who is Affected?</h3>
                <p>Sub-Saharan Africa faces a stark contrast between hunger and food waste. Despite a large hungry population, significant amounts of food are lost at various stages of the supply chain. Smallholder farmers, urban consumers, and vulnerable groups are disproportionately affected. Addressing this issue requires improvements in agricultural practices, food distribution, consumer education, and policy.</p>

                    <li><strong>Research and Development:</strong> We conducted extensive research to understand the root causes of food waste and develop a tailored solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Assembly:</strong> We assembled a team of experts to ensure a comprehensive approach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> We defined our goals, target markets, and business model.</li>
